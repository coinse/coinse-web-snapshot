A good tiding near Christmas... ICST 2016 notifications arrived this morning, and it was a good news. The information theory crew - [Robert Feldt][robert], [Simon Poulding][simon], and [David Clark][david], and I - have been working on a black-box test case selection technique based on [Normalised Compression Distance][ncd], and the paper was accepted by [ICST 2016][icst2016]. You can see the [arXiv preprint][arxiv] while we prepare the camera ready :)
