excerpt: COINSE presents a Slack menubot for KAIST.
---

The very first project COINSE opens up is... something those who live on Slack channels in KAIST will hopefully welcome. [Menubot][menubot] crawls daily menus from various KAIST cafeterias and serves them up in your Slack channel. You can decide before you leave your desk :) The bot is forked from [Hongmoa][hongmoa] and based on Python slackclient. See the [menubot repository][menubot] for more details. Bon app√©tit!
