[Observational slicing][orbs] is an interesting take on program slicing that has been conceived in CREST, UCL. Right after the first paper on program code has been published, I have been pursuing a non-conventional form of slicing on Picture Description Languages. Dave Binkley and Roger Eastman from Loyola University Baltimore joined forces with me, and we had reported our initial findings at [SCAM 2014][scam2014]. I am happy to announce that the [journal version][jv] of the paper has now been accepted by JSS. We extended our initial study with custom-made template matching algorithm, and evaluated our technique on the combination of HTML5, CSS, and Javascript as well.
