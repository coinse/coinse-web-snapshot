Remember the [first URP][first-urp] by Jinsuk Lim, which led to one of the [first batch][first-papers] of student papers from COINSE? Today, KAIST held the 2016 Winter/Spring URP workshop, which allowed 53 participating projects to present their work. I'm very pleased to report that, with an excellent presentation, Jinsuk won one of the three Best Project Awards. Well done indeed!
