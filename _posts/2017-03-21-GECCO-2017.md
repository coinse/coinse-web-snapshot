The product of an undergraduate research internship during the winter by Dahyun Kang has been accepted at [GECCO 2017](http://gecco-2017.sigevo.org) SBSE Track. The paper looks at the usefulness of using a ternary conditional operator for GP-based composition of ranking models for fault localisation. Congratulations! :)
