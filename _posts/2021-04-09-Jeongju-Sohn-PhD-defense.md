Jeongju Sohn, who has been a PhD candidate at COINSE since 2017, has successfully defended her thesis titled "Synergetic Interaction Between Fault Localization and Defect Prediction". Congratulations, Dr. Sohn!

Dr. Sohn has worked on both FL and DP, first by incorporating elements of DP into FL ([Sohn and Yoo, ISSTA 2017](https://coinse.kaist.ac.kr/publications/pdfs/Sohn2017xq.pdf), [TSE 2019](https://coinse.kaist.ac.kr/publications/pdfs/Sohn2019jk.pdf)), and subsequently by incorporating elements of FL into DP ([Sohn et al., SANER 2021](https://coinse.kaist.ac.kr/publications/pdfs/Sohn2021eb.pdf)). Finally, the recent work by Dr. Sohn successfully applied FL technique to large scale industrial CI environment ([Sohn et al., ICST 2021](https://coinse.kaist.ac.kr/publications/pdfs/Sohn2021ea.pdf)).
