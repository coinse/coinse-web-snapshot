Our new paper, "Predictive Mutation Analysis via Natural Language Channel in Source Code" has been accepted for publication
to [TOSEM](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tosem) and a preprint is now available at [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10865).
This work has been done by Jinhan Kim (KAIST), Juyoung Jeon (Handong Global Univ.), Shin Hong (Handong Global Univ.), and Shin Yoo (KAIST).



We propose a new technique named Seshat, a Predictive Mutation Analysis (PMA) technique that can accurately
predict the entire kill matrix, not just the mutation score of the given test suite. Seshat exploits the
natural language channel in code, and learns the relationship between the syntactic and semantic
concepts of each test case and the mutants it can kill, from a given kill matrix.
