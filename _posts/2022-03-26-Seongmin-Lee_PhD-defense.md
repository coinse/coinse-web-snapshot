Seongmin Lee, who has been a PhD candidate at COINSE since 2017, has successfully defended his thesis titled "Statistical Program Dependnece Analysis". Congratulations!!

Dr. Lee started with extending Observational Slicing (ORBS) with lexical information ([Lee et al., JSS 2020](https://coinse.kaist.ac.kr/publications/pdfs/Lee2019aa.pdf)). Subsequently, he worked on generalising ORBS into a full fledged dependence model ([Lee et al., SCAM 2019](https://coinse.kaist.ac.kr/publications/pdfs/Lee2019pl.pdf), [Lee et al., JSS 2021](https://coinse.kaist.ac.kr/publications/pdfs/Lee2021ua.pdf)) using statistical inference. This culminated in the formulation of causal program dependence analysis ([Lee et al., preprint 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09107)), where causal inference is adopted to provide a fundamentally different view of dynamic dependence analysis.
