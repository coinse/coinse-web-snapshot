## What to expect

Thank you for showing interest in joining COINSE. You will be interviewed by both the supervisor and existing group members. The interview process includes:

-   Personal interview with the supervisor
<!-- - A short presentation attended by both the supervisor and the group members -->
-   An opportunity for a casual chat with the whole group
-   A casual discussion of which research area you want to pursue at COINSE

We expect the entire process to last less than an hour. Please send an email to the supervisor ([shin.yoo@kaist.ac.kr](mailto:shin.yoo@kaist.ac.kr)) to book a slot that suits you. When you send the email, attach the required documents that are listed below.

<!-- ## Presentation

You need to prepare two short talks: one about a paper you choose, another about what you want to do if you join COINSE. Please see below for more details.

### Paper Presentation

You are to choose one of the following papers and prepare a short presentation (maximum 10 minutes - **keep the time**). Slides should be in English (your talk can be in either Korean or English). Your presentation should summarise the technical contents of the paper. Expect some questions from the entire group.
