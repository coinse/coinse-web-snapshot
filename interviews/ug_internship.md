title: COINSE Lab Interview, Spring 2022 Undergraduate Internship
---

## What to expect

Thank you for showing interest in an undergraduate research internship at COINSE. You will be interviewed by both the supervisor and existing group members. The interview process includes:

- Personal interview with the supervisor
- A short presentation attended by both the supervisor and the group members
- An opportunity for a casual chat with the whole group

We expect the entire process to finish within an hour, and currently are planning to have interviews during the afternoon of 3rd December 2021 (either physically at E3-1, or virtually over zoom), between 2-4pm. The interview will last about 30 minutes in total. Please send an email to the [supervisor](mailto:shin.yoo@kaist.ac.kr) to book a slot that suits you. 

## What to prepare

You need to prepare two short presentations, and some documents. The first presentation is about the paper you choose, and the second is about what you would like to explore if you do get the internship. Please see below for more details.

Your presentation should summarise the technical contents of the paper. Expect some questions from the entire group.
