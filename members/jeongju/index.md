## Projects

*   'FLUCCS': Using source code metrics, have been widely used in defect prediction, to improve Fault Localization; investigating possible relations between defect prediction and fault localization and applying revealed relations to fault localization for further improvement

*   'FL2DP': Leveraging fault localisation to improve defect prediction. FL2DP, which stands for Fault Localisation to Defect Prediction, aims to enhance Just-In-Time defect prediction by exploiting the insights about defective code from past fault localisation. 

*	'Arachne': Search-based repair of deep neural network. Compared to previous automatic DNN repair technique, Arachne targets to repair a specific type of faults (e.g., classify input A to B) at the expense of the others. Arachne can be applied in the situations where some misbehaviour of a DNN must be fixed even at the cost of breaking other less critical behaviour.
